Today I published a small rubygem called [Slackdo](https://rubygems.org/gems/slackdo), which let's me take control of my TODO items on both Slack and Trello at the same time from the command line. As I'm working in a terminal most of the time this allows me to save a lot of time going back and forth between lists.
