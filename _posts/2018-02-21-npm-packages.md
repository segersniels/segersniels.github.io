title: NPM Packages

I recently released two NPM packages that might be of use to some people.  
The first one is [supdock](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supdock) and basically wraps around the docker command to give you a more visual way to interact with the daemon.  
The second one is called [terraform-ecs-plan-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terraform-ecs-plan-checker) which allows you to check your Terraform plans for changes in ECS container definitions since the last state.

I'm surprised that they have been doing quite well!
