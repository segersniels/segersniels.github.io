title: New job!

I came to the conclusion that my last job wasn't really what I hoped it would be.  
Even though I liked the company's product and enjoyed my time there I had to make a decision. 

So I quit and was lucky enough to get a job at the company where I did my internship, Small Town Heroes, home to DevOps pioneer Patrick Debois! AWS, Docker, Serverless, Terraform and Node.JS here I come (again)! 

I'm up for the challenge!
