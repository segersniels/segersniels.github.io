title: New job!

I came to the conclusion that my last job wasn't really what I hoped it would be.  
Even though I liked the company's product and enjoyed my time there I had to make a decision.

So I quit and was lucky enough to get a job at the company where I did my internship, [Small Town Heroes](http://www.smalltownheroes.be/), home to DevOps pioneer [Patrick Debois](https://twitter.com/patrickdebois)! AWS, Docker, Serverless, Terraform and Node.JS here I come (again)! 

I'm up for the challenge!
