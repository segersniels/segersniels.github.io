								PHP script
							</h2>
							<h3 class="post-subtitle">
								Today I decided to work a bit on the php script I made not long ago. I added functionality so I can add school assignments to the school tab. I simply have to run the script now, type in the title and the url to the pdf file and the script does all the magic in the background. Thinking about adding an option to add stuff to the dutch translation, but that's still a WIP.

							<h3 class="post-subtitle">Since this portfolio is hosted on Github I'm limiting myself to only HTML (I might be a tad lazy to actualy get good hosting). As far as the limit of html goes, that means I can't dynamically keep the website up to date with an admin panel like I learned to do this summer. Therefore I coded a simple CLI <a href="http://pastebin.com/ZnGpCp5Y" target="_blank">script</a> that I use to add these posts directly to my portfolio. The script might be a bit basic but it does what it has to do. I'm glad I started learning php!

							</h2>
							<h3 class="post-subtitle">French translation has been removed from the website, as it was too much work to keep up to date. The English version will always be my priority to keep up to date, Dutch translations will follow ofcourse. The work tab has been updated with a link to the new LANDAY website I spent the entire summer coding on.

                                -The 'About' page links to my LinkedIn profile, which was part of an assignment for International Communication III. This page should contain all the information you need about me.
