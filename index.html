                        I came to the conclusion that my last job wasn't really what I hoped it would be.
                        Even though I liked the company's product and enjoyed my time there I had to make a decision.
                        So I quit and was lucky enough to get a job at the company where I did my internship, <a href="http://smalltownheroes.be" target="_blank">Small Town Heroes</a>, home to DevOps pioneer <a href="https://twitter.com/patrickdebois" target="_blank">Patrick Debois</a>!
                        AWS, Docker, Serverless, Terraform and Node.JS here I come (again)! I'm up for the challenge!

                        Cloudalize will be launching our new cloud gaming platform on Monday the 18th of september called PixelStellar. The platform allows users to connect to a virtual desktop that is heavily focused on offering the best graphical experience. For example, this allows users to play the latest high demanding graphical games on let's say a Raspberry Pi, which takes away the need for a heavy gaming system.

                        For the past 2 months I've been working on automating the datacenter infrastructure for our GPU nodes. I started looking for an automating tool that could both support XenServer and other Linux distributions without a problem. I stumbled upon Razor, a package from the guys behind Puppet, which allows me to easily configure policies and other configurations to PXE boot our physical hardware over in our datacenter without being there. Since Razor only takes care of the OS installation and basic configurations of a machine we needed another tool to automate the provisioning of the machines. This is were Chef came into play where I've been working with for the past few weeks, customising a lot of stuff and writing ruby code.
